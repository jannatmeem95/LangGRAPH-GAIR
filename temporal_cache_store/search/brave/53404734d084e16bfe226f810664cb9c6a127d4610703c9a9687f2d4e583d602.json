In May 2015, Schlein announced through a post on Facebook that she was leaving the PD, being in deep disagreement with the new political line of the party imposed by the party secretary and Italy&#x27;s prime minister Matteo Renzi, and joined Possible, the party founded by Civati.",

    "snippet": "A left-wing radical who abandoned the party last decade under centrist Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s leadership and returned to the fold only a few months ago, Schlein cut her teeth by working as a volunteer for Barack Obama’s U.S. presidential election campaigns in 2008 and 2012 and later became one of the youth leaders of the PD’s left flank.
