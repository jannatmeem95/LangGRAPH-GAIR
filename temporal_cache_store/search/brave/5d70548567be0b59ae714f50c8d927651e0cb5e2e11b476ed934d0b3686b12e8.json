    "snippet": "A left-wing radical who abandoned the party last decade under centrist Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s leadership and returned to the fold only a few months ago, Schlein cut her teeth by working as a volunteer for Barack Obama’s U.S. presidential election campaigns in 2008 and 2012 and later became one of the youth leaders of the PD’s left flank.

    "snippet": "Unlike Meloni, who climbed the political ladder as a loyal member of Italy’s post-fascist, national-conservative tradition, she has tip-toed around the margins of the PD since it was founded in 2007. Schlein even quit the party in 2015, while serving as a member of the European Parliament, when PD leader and then prime minister Matteo Renzi tried to push through economically liberal reforms.",

The presence of a woman at the helm of the first radical-right-led government in the Republic’s history challenged the center-left at the level of leadership, producing a PD segretaria who really seems to be the opposite of Meloni in every way. Meloni’s loyal activism in the local party branch, versus Schlein’s eternal search for political ...",
