    "snippet": "Unlike his seven half-brothers  the so-called Sudairi Seven  Abdullah, did not enjoy the favoured status that accrued to the full sons of Abdulazizs wife Hassa bint Ahmed al-Sudairi, such as his long-term rival, Crown Prince Sultan (who died in 2011). Yet his evident capabilities saw him made crown prince and heir to the throne in 1982, having seven years earlier been appointed second deputy prime minister on the succession of King Khalid. In the crude calculus of House of Saud power politics, Abdullahs leadership of the powerful Saudi Arabian National Guard between 1962 and 2010, delivered him an influential fief that countered that of Sultan, who headed the kingdoms armed forces, and the long-serving Interior Minister (later crown prince) Nayef, who oversaw the state security apparatus.",

    "snippet": "He originally sought to placate extreme Islamist voices—many of which sought to end the Saudi dynasty’s rule—yet the spectre of anti-Saudi and anti-Western violence within the country’s borders led him, for the first time, to order the use of force by the security services against some extremists. At the same time, in 2005 Abdullah responded to demands for greater political inclusiveness by holding the country’s first municipal elections, based on adult male suffrage. Uncertainty surrounding succession in the kingdom was a further source of domestic concern, and late the following year Abdullah issued a new law refining the country’s succession policies.",
