    "snippet": "Now Merz&#x27;s center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) the regional Bavarian Christian Social Union (CSU) and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) will be working together as Germany&#x27;s new government. For Merz, it is a big step in an unusual career. Merz, who is 69 years old, has never held a top governmental office with significant leadership responsibilities. He has never been a federal minister, or a state premier, or even mayor of a small town. He is the oldest chancellor to take office since Konrad Adenauer, the first post-war German head of government (1949–1963).",
