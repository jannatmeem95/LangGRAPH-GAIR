    "snippet": "There would, in all likelihood, have been no Elly Schlein to lead the PD if there had been no Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. The presence of a woman at the helm of the first radical-right-led government in the Republic’s history challenged the center-left at the level of leadership, producing a PD segretaria who really seems to be the opposite of Meloni in every way. Meloni’s loyal activism in the local party branch, versus Schlein’s eternal search for political identity; a hotel-school diploma versus a master’s degree; self-representation as a “traditional” mother versus openly bisexual orientation; and a border-obsessed nationalism versus battles in defense of migrants.",

Schlein, for instance, supports a minimum wage — a proposal which the Democratic Party has endorsed but failed to push through while in government.",
