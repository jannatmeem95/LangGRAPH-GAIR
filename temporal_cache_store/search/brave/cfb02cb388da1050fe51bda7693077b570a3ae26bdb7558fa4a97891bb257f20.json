    "snippet": "Much of Dawkins’s work has generated debate for asserting the supremacy of science over religion in explaining the world. He also asserts that laws of probability preclude the existence of an omnipotent creator. After earning his master’s and doctorate degrees in zoology in 1966 at the University of Oxford under famed ethologist Nikolaas Tinbergen (who was best known for his work with both instinctive and learned behaviour), Richard Dawkins assisted Tinbergen before becoming an assistant professor of zoology (1967–69) at the University of California, Berkeley.",
