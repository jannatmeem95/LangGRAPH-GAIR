    "snippet": "In 2008 and 2012, Schlein volunteered on Barack Obama&#x27;s two presidential campaigns in the United States. In 2011, she was one of the founders of the association of university students known as Progrè, an association that dealt with deepening and sensitising public opinion on issues related to migration policies and the prison reality. In April 2013, Romano Prodi, former Prime Minister of Italy and president of the Democratic Party (PD), received in support less than 100 centre-left coalition electors and left the 2013 Italian presidential election campaign.",

    "snippet": "A left-wing radical who abandoned the party last decade under centrist Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s leadership and returned to the fold only a few months ago, Schlein cut her teeth by working as a volunteer for Barack Obama’s U.S. presidential election campaigns in 2008 and 2012 and later became one of the youth leaders of the PD’s left flank. In a first for Italy’s traditionally male-dominated politics, both Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and the de facto leader of the opposition are women — with completely different ideology.",

    "snippet": "After cutting her political teeth across the Atlantic, Schlein became an impassioned youth activist for the Democratic Party and was elected as a member of the European Parliament in 2014. Come the following year, and increasingly opposed to the labour reforms of the then-PM and party leader, Renzi, she ultimately parted ways with the PD and joined a splinter party, Possible (Possibile). In 2020, Elly Schlein was elected on a centre-left ticket in Emilia-Romagna, a historically communist region that risked succumbing to Matteo Salvini’s anti-immigrant, populist Northern League in the regional elections.",

    "snippet": "There would, in all likelihood, have been no Elly Schlein to lead the PD if there had been no Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. The presence of a woman at the helm of the first radical-right-led government in the Republic’s history challenged the center-left at the level of leadership, producing a PD segretaria who really seems to be the opposite of Meloni in every way. Meloni’s loyal activism in the local party branch, versus Schlein’s eternal search for political identity; a hotel-school diploma versus a master’s degree; self-representation as a “traditional” mother versus openly bisexual orientation; and a border-obsessed nationalism versus battles in defense of migrants.",

    "snippet": "Unlike Meloni, who climbed the political ladder as a loyal member of Italy’s post-fascist, national-conservative tradition, she has tip-toed around the margins of the PD since it was founded in 2007. Schlein even quit the party in 2015, while serving as a member of the European Parliament, when PD leader and then prime minister Matteo Renzi tried to push through economically liberal reforms.",
