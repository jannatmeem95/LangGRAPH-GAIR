    "snippet": "Strange though it might seem about a club who won a European trophy last season, then followed it up by becoming world club champions, this was the day when Maresca finally felt like a proper Chelsea manager. It was the game where his side completed the fewest passes, and won the most aerial duels, from his 51 league games in charge. It won’t be like this every game, and nor should it be. But with Chelsea’s next game a trip to a physical Leeds United side on a cold December evening, some of these qualities might be needed again very soon.",
